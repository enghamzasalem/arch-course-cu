## Overview

This assignment presents the architectural design of a Smart Device Management System.  
It includes component and connector diagrams, multiple architectural views, quality attribute analysis, architectural pattern selection, architectural decisions, and technical debt evaluation.

## Files Included

### Part 1 – Architecture Fundamentals

- `part1_component_connector_diagram.drawio` – Component and connector diagram  
- `part1_component_connector_diagram.png` – Image version of the diagram  
- `part1_architecture_vs_design.md` – Architecture vs design explanation  

### Part 2 – Quality Attributes & Multiple Views

- `part2_quality_attributes.md` – Quality attributes analysis and prioritization  
- `part2_multiple_views.drawio` – Logical, sequence, and deployment views  
- `part2_multiple_views-Logical View.drawio.png` – Logical view diagram  
- `part2_multiple_views-Scenarios_Sequence View.drawio.png` – Sequence view diagram  
- `part2_multiple_views-Physical_Deployment View.drawio.png` – Deployment view diagram  

### Part 3 – Architectural Pattern & Decisions

- `part3_architectural_pattern.drawio` – Architectural pattern diagram  
- `part3_architectural_pattern.png` – Pattern diagram image  
- `part3_pattern_justification.md` – Justification of selected pattern  
- `part3_architectural_decisions.md` – Architectural decisions documentation  

### Part 4 – Technical Debt & Architectural Smells

- `part4_technical_debt.md` – Technical debt analysis  
- `part4_architectural_smells.md` – Identified architectural smells  
- `part4_smell_refactoring.drawio` – Refactoring diagrams  
- `part4_smell_refactoring-Smell 1 - God Component (Device Manager).drawio.png` – Smell 1 refactoring  
- `part4_smell_refactoring-Smell 2 - Single Point of Failure (API Gateway).drawio.png` – Smell 2 refactoring

## Key Highlights

- Applied core architectural concepts  
- Documented architectural decisions  
- Created architectural diagrams to represent the system structure  

## How to View

1. Open `.drawio` files in draw.io to see editable diagrams
2. View `.png` files for quick reference
3. Read `.md` files for documentation
